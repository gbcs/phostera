To restrict previously connected directors or streamers, use the Block feature in the Server page of Settings.

To manage footage filmed for a director, use the View Takes feature, on a given director, in the Server page of Settings.

To disable sharing from your device, switch the 'Run Server' feature in the Server page of Settings, to off.

Note that if the camera is not running, the server is not running. It only runs when the app is showing on screen.

Phostera Director will install a project, which will contain a number of camera modes.

When using one of these modes, footage will be stored by take and is available to the Director when it is in range.

Generally it is recommended to install external storage on the cameras and configure the director to backup footage to storage and to collect proxy versions of the footage for review/streaming over the network.

A connected Phostera streamer can stream what your camera is currently seeing to the world.

It can also download (to then stream) any footage stored on your camera that has been taken via one of the Director modes.
